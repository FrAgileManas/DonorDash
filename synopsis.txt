Synopsis for Major Project Proposal: DonorDash ApplicaƟon
Project Title:
DonorDash: Simplifying the Process of Finding Blood Donors Through an Integrated Mobile
ApplicaƟon
1. IntroducƟon
The need for blood donaƟons is a criƟcal aspect of healthcare, with millions of lives depending on
Ɵmely blood transfusions. However, finding a compaƟble donor in Ɵmes of emergency can oŌen be
Ɵme-consuming and challenging. This project aims to create a mobile applicaƟon that simplifies the
process of connecƟng individuals in urgent need of blood with potenƟal donors. The app will allow
users to raise requests based on their blood group and locaƟon, and noƟfy matching donors,
ensuring swiŌ communicaƟon and coordinaƟon. The project is intended to enhance the blood
donaƟon process, increase engagement with potenƟal donors, and provide educaƟonal content to
raise awareness about the importance of donaƟng blood.
2. ObjecƟve
The primary objecƟve of the DonorDash applicaƟon is to streamline the process of finding blood
donors by:
 Providing an easy-to-use plaƞorm where individuals seeking blood can raise requests based
on specific requirements such as locaƟon and blood group.
 Allowing potenƟal donors to receive real-Ɵme noƟficaƟons and RSVP to requests that match
their profile.
 FacilitaƟng a smooth communicaƟon process between the seeker and donor using an in-app
chat feature, along with locaƟon-sharing funcƟonality for beƩer coordinaƟon.
 Engaging users through addiƟonal features, such as a counter to showcase the number of
lives saved and educaƟonal content or stories related to blood donaƟons.
3. Features of the ApplicaƟon
The DonorDash app will have the following key features:
a. Raise Request for Blood:
The central funcƟonality will enable users in need of blood to raise a request by specifying their
blood group and current locaƟon. This request will be sent as a noƟficaƟon to users who match the
criteria, allowing them to respond quickly.
b. RSVP NoƟficaƟon for Donors:
Users who match the seeker’s blood group and locaƟon will receive a noƟficaƟon. They can choose
to RSVP, confirming their availability to donate. The RSVP feature ensures that the seeker is only
connected to donors willing to assist at that moment.
c. In-App Chat and LocaƟon Sharing:
Once a donor RSVPs to a request, both the seeker and donor will be able to communicate through an
integrated chat feature called "Inox." The chat interface will also include the ability to share
locaƟons, allowing both parƟes to coordinate the blood donaƟon efficiently.
d. Lives Saved Counter:
For engagement and moƟvaƟon, the app will feature a visible counter on the home screen, tracking
and displaying the total number of lives saved through successful donaƟons facilitated by the
plaƞorm. This counter will serve as a reminder of the app’s impact and encourage further
parƟcipaƟon.
e. EducaƟonal Content and Stories:
The app will host arƟcles, short educaƟonal snippets, and real-life stories of people whose lives have
been saved through blood donaƟons. This content will raise awareness about the importance of
blood donaƟon and encourage users to stay engaged with the plaƞorm.
4. Technology Stack
The applicaƟon will be developed using the following technologies:
 Front-end: FluƩer or React NaƟve for a cross-plaƞorm experience on both Android and iOS.
 Back-end: Firebase or Node.js for user authenƟcaƟon, real-Ɵme noƟficaƟon management,
and database management.
 Database: Cloud Firestore or MongoDB for storing user data, requests, and chat history.
 APIs: Google Maps API or other geolocaƟon services to enable locaƟon sharing between the
seeker and donor.
5. Benefits and Impact
The DonorDash app is designed to save lives by reducing the Ɵme and effort required to find
compaƟble donors. By facilitaƟng instant noƟficaƟons and direct communicaƟon between seekers
and donors, the app will significantly increase the efficiency of the blood donaƟon process.
AddiƟonally, the inclusion of educaƟonal content will encourage users to become regular donors,
thereby creaƟng a community of individuals commiƩed to helping others in Ɵmes of need.
Furthermore, the lives saved counter will moƟvate users by showcasing the impact of their
contribuƟons. This feature, along with real-life success stories, will foster a sense of accomplishment
and encourage consistent engagement on the plaƞorm.
6. Conclusion
The DonorDash applicaƟon addresses a crucial problem in healthcare by providing a seamless and
efficient plaƞorm for individuals seeking blood donaƟons. With its real-Ɵme noƟficaƟon system, in-
app communicaƟon, and educaƟonal features, the app aims to not only simplify the process of
finding donors but also inspire a community-driven approach to saving lives. This project holds the
potenƟal to make a significant impact on society by ensuring that blood donaƟons are just a few taps
away.
